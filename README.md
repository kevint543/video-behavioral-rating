# video-behavioral-rating
create a continuous rating for a video clip
This MATLAB-based behavioral rating tool can allow you to play a video and do the simultaneous rating with a mouse or touchpad.

The temoral resolution of the rating can be assign, but no faster than the FPS of that video.

It is easy to use: move the curser toward the top or button of the screen in order to rate a higher or lower scale without any clicks.
